# Git Usage

## Manual

To read the manual: 'man git'

Manual shortcuts:

- 'q': quit
- 'j', 'k': one line down/up
- 'd', 'u': half-page down/up

- '/term': search for 'term'
- 'n', 'N': next/previous search term

## Commands

In Git, commands are divided into high-level ("porcelain") and low-level ("plumbing") commands.

99% of the time, you'll be using porcelain/high-level commands. 

### Porcelain Commands:

(Assuming a 'git' before the command)

- status
- add
- commit
- push
- pull
- log


### Plumbing Commands:

(Assuming the same as above)

- apply
- commit-tree
- hash-object
