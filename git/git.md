# Git

Git is a version control system. Basically, it keeps track of changes in code, and thus can be used to:

- keep a history of code changes
- revert mistakes in code
- collaborate with other developers
- make backups of code
- and much more

While Git can be used for all files, and not just code, it is built mainly with code and developers in mind.

*Note.* The Git system/software is separate from GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket, all of which are commercial products that use Git.
