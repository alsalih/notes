# Methodology

This paper's purpose is to contain the methodology, or process, for the various notes to be made. For example, it can be seen as a writing guide, or a style guide, for the notes.

## Notes File Structure

Notes for a topic shall be contained in one folder with the same name as the topic

Under each topic folder there shall be:

- a general 'name.md' file where 'name' is the topic's name (e.g. git.md for the topic 'Git')
- a 'one-pager.md' file with a concise summary of the topic, focusing on the most useful theoretical and practical information.
- a 'notes.md' file with notes on the topic

Additionally, where applicable, there shall be:

- a 'setup.md' file with setup instructions
- a 'usage.md' file with usage instructions
- a 'media' folder to contain media
    - a 'images' folder under the media folder for images
    - other folders for each type of media

## General Instructions

Notes shall be structured in this format:

- Title
- Introduction (untitled, just a small paragraph under the title)
- Summary
- Headings and content...

Personal touches are allowed (e.g. a quote between the title and intro, etc.) but they should remain appropriate and their main intention and purpose being (as with everything else) the reader's learning and experience.

## Files

### Main Topic File (name.md)

In this file, provide:

- Topic introduction and summary

- a 1/2 to 3/4 page-length section about the most useful information on the topic (the 80%)
- a 1/4 to 1/3 page-length section about the next most-useful or potentially useful information on the topic (up to here, we hope to achieve 99% of use cases)

### Notes File (notes.md)

In this file, provide:

- notes on the topic or subject.

### Setup File (setup.md)

In this file, provide:

- setup instructions for setting up the tool (or whatever it is).
