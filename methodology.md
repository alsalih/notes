## Notes Structure

Notes shall be structured in this format:

- Title
- Introduction (untitled, just a small paragraph under the title)
- Summary

Personal touches are allowed (e.g. a quote between the title and intro, etc.) but they should remain appropriate and their main intention and purpose being (as with everything else) the reader's learning and experience.
